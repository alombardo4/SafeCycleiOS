SafeCycleiOS
============

SafeCycle for iOS can track a user's speed using the device's GPS and change the volume of the Music app.

To build this app, simply open in Xcode 5 or later and click Build. You will need to change some certificates and provisioning profiles to match your developer profile. You'll also need to have an Apple Developer subscription in order to deploy to a device.
